                InfiniCoin is a numeric class for incremental games.<br/>
                By using InfiniCoin, you can keep track of vastly large numbers for any use such as scoring or for in-game currency.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While working with human readable values such as a million or a trillion, the naming conventions are standard. It is possible to store and display the score, when it is within the range of comprehensible numbers.
            <p>
                What if you want to develop an infinite idle game that has a structure where the score and, by extension, the upgrade costs constantly increase? InfiniCoin provides a system for exactly that.
            </p>

            <p>
                InfiniCoin registers the power of 1000 and the base value of the number, and this way the class can represent values up to 999 x 1000 ^ 2 ^ 64. It supports comparisons and operations with other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other standard numeric classes, so that you can build your game engine easily and modularly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By using the Configuration class, the ICConfig, you can set the naming system for large numbers, define how to print the numbers, override names or even create your own naming systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                The demo folder in this package contains 4 demos, displaying various use cases, starting from very basic initializations and operations, to a demo idle game that
                uses InfiniCoin objects to record and track ever increasing values for the budget, asset prices, upgrade costs and production values.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each demo contains its own documentation. For the functionality of this package, refer to the method and field list below.
            </p>

                <h3>InfiniName</h3>
                <p>
                    Each InfiniCoin object is composed of two components: the base value, and the power of 1000. The power of 1000 defines the name of the number.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The following 8 naming systems come as a default with this package. Unless overriden, each power of 1000 is named by the convention represented by one of the enumerations below. The default configuration is base26.
                </p>

                <p><strong>repeating: </strong>Powers of 1000 are represented by increasing letters. Number names go as:<br/>aa, bb, cc, ..., aaa, bbb, ccc</p>
                <p><strong>repeatingCapital: </strong>Powers of 1000 are represented by increasing letters, in capital. Number names go as:<br/>AA, BB, CC, ..., AAA, BBB, CCC</p>
                <p><strong>repeatingSingleStart: </strong>Powers of 1000 are represented by increasing letters, starting from single letters. Number names go as:<br/>a, b, c, ..., aa, bb, cc</p>
                <p><strong>repeatingCapitalSingleStart: </strong>Powers of 1000 are represented by increasing letters, starting from single letters and written in capital. Number names go as:<br/>A, B, C, ..., AA, BB, CC</p>
                <p><strong>base26: </strong>Powers of 1000 are represented by a base26 number system (without a '0' equivalent) where each digit is a letter. Number names go as:<br/>aa, ab, ac, ad, ..., ba, bb, bc, bd</p>
                <p><strong>base26Capital: </strong>Powers of 1000 are represented by a base26 number system (without a '0' equivalent), where each digit is a letter and starts with single digits. Number names go as:<br/>a, b, c, d, ..., aa, ab, ac, ad</p>
                <p><strong>base26SingleStart: </strong>Powers of 1000 are represented by a base26 number system (without a '0' equivalent) where each digit is a capital letter. Number names go as:<br/>AA, AB, AC, AD, ..., BA, BB, BC, BD</p>
                <p><strong>base26CapitalSingleStart: </strong>Powers of 1000 are represented by a base26 number system (without a '0' equivalent), where each digit is a capital letter and starts with single digits. Number names go as:<br/>A, B, C, D, ..., AA, AB, AC, AD</p>

                <p><strong>static uint skip</strong> Read-only. Number of leading names, used for shifting the naming system accordingly.</p>

                <h4>Public Methods</h4>
                <p><strong>Reset(): </strong>Returns the ICConfig object to its default settings. That is: base26 naming system, verbose mode off, print precision is set to 2, repeating name is capped at 4, leading names are "", "k", "m", "g", "t" and all overridden names removed.</p>
                <p><strong>OverrideName(string oldName, string newName): </strong>When the naming system is used, you might want to avoid certain words that are generated by the system. Or, you might want to implement your own naming system from scratch. Name overriding is used for this purpose. This function overrides the old name, defined by <span id="code">string oldName</span>, which is an existing name in the current system, with a new one, defined by <span id="code">string newName</span>.</p>
                <p><strong>OverrideName(long key, string name): </strong>Similarly, this function replaces the default name for the <span id="code">long key</span> power of 1000 by <span id="code">string name</span></p>

                <p><strong>SetPrintPrecision(int precision): </strong>Sets the number of decimal places for converting InfiniCoin objects to a string.</p>
                <p><strong>SetRepeatingNameCap(int cap): </strong>Sets the repeating name cap, explained in public fields section.</p>
                <p><strong>RemoveLeadingNames(): </strong>Removes all the leading names, meaning that the numbers will start to get generated names right from 1000^0.</p>
                <p><strong>SetLeadingNames(string leadingName1, string leadingName2, ..., string leadingNameN): </strong>Sets the leading names as the given, arbitrary number of string objects, in the given order.</p>
                <p><strong>SetLeadingNames(IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; leadingNames): </strong>Sets the leading names as the given, numerable collection of string objects.</p>
                <p><strong>string Name(long kPow, bool useOverriden = true): </strong>Converts the power of 1000 to the name, based on the naming system. if <span id="code">useOverriden</span> is set to true, which is the default, then the overriden names are used. If set the false, the original name is returned.</p>
                <p><strong>long Name2Power(string name): </strong>Converts the name to the power of 1000. This function does not use the overriden names.</p>

                <h4>Implicit conversions, Operators and Comparisons</h4>
                <p>
                    InfiniCoin objects can be implicitly initialized by assigning a numeric value like any other numeric class by defining them like this:<br/>
                    <span id="code">InfiniCoin ic = 5000000;</span><br/>
                    ic, when printed in default configuration, would read: "5.00 m"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following operations can be applied to InfiniCoin objects:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>+: </strong>InfiniCoin objects can be added to other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other numeric classes.</li>
                        <li><strong>++: </strong>When incremented, the <strong>base value</strong> is incremented by one. For instance, 100k, when incremented by one, would become 101k, whereas 100g would become 101g. The former increases by 1000^1, while the latter increases by 1000^3.</li>
                        <li><strong>-: </strong>InfiniCoin objects can be subtracted from other InfiniCoin objects. Other numeric classes can be subtracted from InfiniCoin objects and the result is again an InfiniCoin object. Since this is an unsigned class, the value, when below 0, is clamped at zero.</li>
                        <li><strong>--: </strong>When decremented, the <strong>base value</strong> is decremented by one. For instance, 100k, when incremented by one, would become 99k, whereas 100g would become 99g. The former increases by 1000^1, while the latter increases by 1000^3.</li>
                        <li><strong>*: </strong>InfiniCoin objects can be multiplied by other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other numeric classes.</li>
                        <li><strong>/: </strong>InfiniCoin objects can be divided by other InfiniCoin objects. InfiniCoin objects can be divided by other numeric classes, and the result is again an InfiniCoin object. When divided by zero, the InfiniCoin object becomes NaN.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The following comparisons are available for InfiniCoin objects:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>==: </strong> InfiniCoin objects can be checked for equality against other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other numeric classes.</li>

                        <li><strong>!=: </strong> InfiniCoin objects can be checked for inequality against other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other numeric classes.</li>

                        <li><strong>&lt;: </strong> InfiniCoin objects can be compared to see if they are less than other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other numeric classes.</li>

                        <li><strong>&gt;: </strong> InfiniCoin objects can be compared to see if they are greater than other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other numeric classes.</li>

                        <li><strong>&le;: </strong> InfiniCoin objects can be compared to see if they are less than or equal to other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other numeric classes.</li>

                        <li><strong>&ge;: </strong> InfiniCoin objects can be compared to see if they are greater than or equal to other InfiniCoin objects, as well as other numeric classes.</li>
                    </ul>
